Developing a simple yet effective solution to performing the suicide burn (termed *hoverslam* by SpaceX)

### Goals
- Requires minimal data input from on-board sensors
- Effectively cuts all velocity to zero once on the landing site
- Computationally simple, enabling quick correction adjustments
- Enabling development of flight computers for more spacecraft capable of powered landing, on Earth or on other celestial bodies

### Timeline
- Jan. 2026: Initiated project, ran simple derivations assuming minimal horizontal velocity
- Feb. 2026: Improved on given limitations, including correcting to include horizontal momentum (calculated via flight path angle)

### Outputs
- 1 draft paper in Overleaf
- 2 posts on this website
- 2 KSP simulations (repeated across 10+ quicksaves) in vacuum conditions
- Multiple KSP atmospheric booster landing attempts (no calculations applied)

### Future Plans
- Include mass changes during the landing burn
- Address atmospheric drag for landings involving atmospheric reentry and terminal velocity
- Create a simple, computationally cheap program for flight computers to repeatedly run during descent, executing corrective adjustments mid-flight
