Hey there :) 

I’m Peter Jiang, a high school student based in Virginia that goes by the online username Daszeal. 

I focus mainly on modeling and self-teaching astronautical engineering/rocketry using kinematic theory then testing my results in Kerbal Space Program. Some of my current goals are to perfect a model that can be used for launch vehicle reusability and spacecraft descent.

Most of my posts on this site will be sharing some of my findings or learnings, though I may throw in some random physics, astronomy or gaming related topics that I find interesting. 

Also a Minecraft 1.9+ PvPer, untested, main gamemodes being Vanilla/Crystal and SMP.

I am not a professional coder nor have a good understanding of how websites work. If something weird happens when you're browsing don't be that surprised.

My main points of contact are in the footer links. I am most active on X ([@ddaszeal](https://x.com/ddaszeal)), regularly posting about current updates, personal or engineering-related. All my full works will be on this site, however.

SpaceX follower. Space Shuttle lover. Ad astra.
