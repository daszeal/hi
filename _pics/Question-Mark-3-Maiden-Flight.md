First operational spaceplane capable of single-stage-to-orbit. Pictured taking off from the KSC. 

Vehicle uses 4 RAPIERs for ascent and 1 NERV for orbit insertion.

Crew capacity of two Kerbals, can also be autonomously controlled using the built-in drone core.

Design uses vertical stabilizers located on the wingtips instead of the fuselage to facilitate docking on its zenith side.
