The test probe had its flight path angle, altitude, downrange distance to landing site, and velocity inputted into [this function](https://daszeal.github.io/2026/02/08/Adding-Instantaneous-Flight-Path-Angle-to-the-Calculation/), determining its throttle percentage.

Multiple trials were conducted via quicksaves, yielding above-average results, albeit requiring mid-burn corrections to adjust for the change in mass.
