Newest Plus model replaces inline clamp-o-tron with a singular docking port in its zenith to save weight. 

This model also includes eight reaction control thrusters placed on its fuselage, which were tested in orbit.

This model is conducting reentry with a higher angle-of-attack due to past models having moderate heating problems at its nose. Test results nominal.

All tests conducted are unmanned.
